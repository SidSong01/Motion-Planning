"""
Two data structures are provided for your open and closed lists: 

 1. OrderedSet is an ordered collection of unique elements.
 2. PriorityQueue is a key-value container whose `pop()` method always pops out
    the element whose value has the highest priority.

 Common operations of OrderedSet, and PriorityQueue
   len(s): number of elements in the container s
   x in s: test x for membership in s
   x not in s: text x for non-membership in s
   s.clear(): clear s
   s.remove(x): remove the element x from the set s;
                nothing will be done if x is not in s

 Unique operations of OrderedSet:
   s.add(x): add the element x into the set s
   s.pop(): return and remove the LAST added element in s;

 Example:
   s = Set()
   s.add((0,1,2))    # add a triplet into the set
   s.remove((0,1,2)) # remove the element (0,1,2) from the set
   x = s.pop()

 Unique operations of PriorityQueue:
   PriorityQueue(order="min", f=lambda v: v): build up a priority queue
       using the function f to compute the priority based on the value
       of an element
   s.put(x, v): add the element x with value v into the queue
                update the value of x if x is already in the queue
   s.get(x): get the value of the element x
            raise KeyError if x is not in s
   s.pop(): return and remove the element with highest priority in s;
            raise IndexError if s is empty
            if order is "min", the element with minimum f(v) will be popped;
            if order is "max", the element with maximum f(v) will be popped.
 Example:
   s = PriorityQueue(order="min", f=lambda v: v.f)
   s.put((1,1,1), Value(f=2,g=1))
   s.put((2,2,2), Value(f=5,g=2))
   x, v = s.pop()  # the element with minimum value of v.f will be popped
