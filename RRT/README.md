## Introduction


The main objectives of this project are:
* Simple execution for RRT algorithm.
* Play with it by changing the obstacales, step length, start and goal, etc. 
* Note that the step length and the goalSampleRate need to be tuned for best performance in different enviroment.


## Details About How to Play
